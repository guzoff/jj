## Jail for those who didn't obey the OOP Rules

It's my first pet-project made with Hibernate & Spring MVC.

Before running this app on your server, be sure to set appropriate values for the following properties:  
**jdbc.url  
jdbc.username  
jdbc.password**  
These properties are in the file: **_src/main/resources/application.properties_**  
And you should obviously use **MySQL** rdbms =)

Enjoy!
